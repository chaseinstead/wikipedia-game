# wikipedia game (work in progress)
finds the shortest connection between any two wikipedia pages.

in order to play, please open "wikipedia-game.ipynb", select a start (start_page) and goal page (goal_page)-

in case your country is censored and cannot open the standard wikipedia URL, you can change the "base" variable to whereever you are accessing wikipedia from.

# to do
- print out the number of interrogated websites every n seconds
- save and print out the path it takes to get from start to goal page.
- visualize the path.
- enable parallel downloads of pages so it reaches the result quicker (concurrent requests!)
