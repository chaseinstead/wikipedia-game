# wikipedia game (work in progress)
finds the shortest connection between any two wikipedia pages

# to do
- print out the number of interrogated websites every n seconds
- make the program print out the path it takes to get from start to goal page.
- visualize the path.
- enable parallel downloads of pages so it reaches the result quicker (concurrent requests?)
