LET'S GO: Starting to search the shortest connection between https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst-
Th%C3%A4lmann-Park and https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabinettsorder

Round 1 completed without results. Starting round 2.
Stay tuned - 2794 links searched, none matched the goal page so far...

DONE: The goal page can be reached with 2 clicks.

This is the path: Ernst-ThÃ¤lmann-Park ---> GASAG ---> Kabinettsorder
